# Statistics-Calculator
 This is a very basic statistics calculator I built to help me with my ever so tedious highschool stats homework.
 Actually, this was my very first programming project in general.
 Only has support for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
 This code could and definately should be cleaned up, which I might get to on a rainy day.
